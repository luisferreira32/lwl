# Light Weight Language

A light weight language created to learn how to do a compiler.

## Rules
* We want it simple.
* Imports are for the weak, you should be able to write your entire OS in **ONE** file, all with **ORIGINAL** implementations.
* Return value is **MANDATORY**, but there can be only **ONE**.
* There are **NO** floats! We only **EXACT** numbers.
* Pointers... will be a second thought.
