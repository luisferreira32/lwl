# Light Weight Language

A light weight language created to learn how to do a compiler.

## Rules to Follow Coherently
* We want it simple.
* Imports are for the weak, you should be able to write your entire OS in **ONE** file, all with **ORIGINAL** implementations.
* Return value is **MANDATORY**, but there can be only **ONE**.
* There are **NO** floats! We only deal **EXACT** numbers .
* Pointers... will be a second thought.

## Contribution

Feel free to open issues, pull requests, and/or propose changes in the language. The RFCs (rules to follow coherently) should be... followed.
