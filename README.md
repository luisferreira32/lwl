# Light Weight Language

A light weight language created to learn how to do a compiler.

## Rules to Follow Coherently
1. **Integers, integers, integers...**
2. And some **functions**!

## Contribution

Feel free to open issues, pull requests, and/or propose changes in the language. The RFCs (rules to follow coherently) should be... followed.

## Roadmap

- [ ] MVP (AST + syntax check + assembly)
- [ ] Add concept of structs and arrays
- [ ] Enable compiler plugins
- [ ] Demo compiler plugin string to 8 bit integer array
- [ ] Demo compiler plugin to decide integer type based on architecture to compile
